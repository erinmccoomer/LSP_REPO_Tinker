Final Question 4:

One instance where using a design pattern may not be beneficial is when it introduces unnecessary complexity 
to a simple problem. This was discussed in lecture as a common downside: while patterns promote flexibility 
and reuse, they can overcomplicate the design if applied in the wrong context. As noted in the “Introduction 
to Design Patterns” slides, “Although design patterns are useful in promoting flexibility, this may be at the 
expense of a more complicated design.” In some cases, implementing the pattern itself takes more time and effort 
than the problem warrants. The solution can become overly layered, with additional classes or interfaces that 
don’t provide meaningful benefit. A key takeaway from class was that good design is about clarity and 
simplicity—just because a pattern exists does not mean it should be used.
